#### Transaction Ranges:

ATMs are categorized into transaction ranges such as Below 10K, 10K-20K, 20K-25K, and so on.
- **Top Performers**: ATMs with transaction volumes above 50K show strong performance in terms of uptime (93.3%) and gross profit (64.11%).
- **Low Performers**: ATMs with less than 10K transactions exhibit a higher gross profit percentage (249.74%) but also reflect inefficiencies in terms of operational uptime (82.6%).
- **Conclusion**: This section allows for easy identification of high- and low-performing ATMs, offering actionable insights into how to manage underperforming ATMs more effectively and increase transaction volumes.


#### Margin Range Analysis:

##### Current Month:
ATMs are categorized based on performance margins (0-5%, 10-15%, etc.). The dashboard captures how many ATMs fall into each margin band, with over 2,374 ATMs achieving margins above 30%, indicating high profitability.
